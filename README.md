# Tracking-orange-book

This code tracks an orange object in a frame and makes a rectangle around its centroid.

Most of the code was taken from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/. Detection of the range of HSV palette used for producing the mask was done using the latter code https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils/blob/master/bin/range-detector.
